## January 1st-15th

_Note: this journal entry was written on February 11th mostly by referring to entries from my personal journal log in this time period._

Welcome to my first "written" journal log on this site. This entry will mostly be a recap of what happened during the first two weeks of 2022, although I'll also be including some of my other thoughts here from time to time, as well as anything else I feel like writing here. (Note that when I say anything else, I really do mean "anything else".)

The most significant event of the first two weeks of 2022 is my opening of a CodeForces account. I knew about CodeForces since last year, but I waited until the start of 2022 to create my account as I was still getting used to in person classes at SFU during the Winter 2021 term. Thus, I made it such that one of my main motives for 2022 would be to officially join CodeForces and see just how far I could progress over the span of a year. As of writing this (on Feb 11th), I have participated in 7 contests which all started at 6:35AM, with the first two being on January 3rd and January 10th. So how did those go?

The first contest I participated in was Hello 2022, and while it was easily my worst performance out of the contests I have participated so far, I took away two key lessons. First lesson is pretty blatently obvious being that a good night of sleep before a contest is essential, as the night before the contest, as my Fitbit describes it, I was restless 19 times, woke up at 4:00AM (two hours earlier than intended), and was asleep for the grand total of 5 hours and 18 minutes. This I attribute to my own nerves getting excited/anxious at my first coding contest in about a year, and this mess of a rest partially contributed to the second lesson I learnt.
