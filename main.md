# alxwen711.github.io
Hello, and welcome to my Github Webpage. Here I write about mostly coding related topics. Currently this entails what I've done on CodeForces over the year, but future posts may also include recaps of my progress on other projects located on my Github. Check the Todo list for what my current plans are.

## Todo list
(Highlighted are top priority)

- **Longer article about CodeForces' rating system, SpeedForces, and what rating actually means**. This will be a separate post from biweekly updates. Another post is also planned as a full review of my first year on CodeForces.

- [**Python Competitive Library**](https://github.com/alxwen711/py-competitive-library): Updates are happening to this repository on a regular basis with new algorithm/data structure/template files.

- [Bidding Java game](https://github.com/alxwen711/biddingGame): This is mainly to house an AI I am making for this on the Hackerrank problem, still heavily WIP

- About me page: Goal is to have a more fleshed out about me page, right now there isn't much there
