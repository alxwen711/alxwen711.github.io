## alxwen711.github.io
Hello, and welcome to my Github Webpage.

On this website I will be posting some of my coding projects as well as many other code related things. I might also write down some math stuff here as well. For now, since this site is using Jekyll to format everything and make sure that this page is not just a wall of HTML code, the sample text below is being kept here for reference. Once enough has been actually created on this website it will be removed.

- Bidding Tic-Tac-Toe Java game: This is mainly to house the AI I made for this on the Hackerrank problem

- **About me page**: Goal is to have a more fleshed out about me page, right now there isn't much there
