# alxwen711.github.io
Hello, and welcome to my Github Webpage. Here I write about mostly coding related topics. Currently this entails what I've done on CodeForces over the year, but future posts may also include recaps of my progress on other projects located on my Github. Check the Todo list for what my current plans are.

## Todo list
(Highlighted are top priority)

- [**Python Competitive Library**](https://github.com/alxwen711/py-competitive-library): Updates are happening to this repository on a regular basis with new algorithm/data structure/template files.

- [Bidding Java game](https://github.com/alxwen711/biddingGame): This is mainly to house an AI I am making for this on the Hackerrank problem, still heavily WIP

- End of year recap post: Will also be posted to CodeForces. This doubles as a how to get to Expert post. (It's meant to be a how to reach CM post but with how September went there's unsuprisingly a change of plans.)

- About me page: Goal is to have a more fleshed out about me page, right now there isn't much there
