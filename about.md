## About the webpage creator

Hello there! I'm Alexander Wen, but just call me Alex. I am currently a 3rd year student at SFU majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. You're probably reading this "About me" page either because you saw one of my posts on CodeForces, you're part of my family, or you're lost on the Internet. Either way, welcome to my GitHub webpage where I claim to write about Computer Science related stuff even though 99% of the content is really competitive programming.

What really got me into Computer Science were coding competitions. Theyâ€™re like the Pascal/Galois/Hypatia math contests I did a lot of back in high school. Both competitions have an aspect of problem solving that I like, and apply fundemental concepts in creative ways. At the moment, most of the competitions I take part in are hosted on the CodeForces website, but I have accounts on various other competitive programming sites as well (being CodeChef, Hackerrank, etc.).

If you're still reading this, then here are some completely random facts about me. They might be interesting, but I just put them here because I felt like it.

- I really enjoy Japanese and Korean cuisine, and my all time favourite food is Korean beef ribs. Admittedly, I also enjoy instant Korean fire noodles, and on a few occasions added in my own hot sauce into them to make them even spicier.

- In my high school yearbook there is a picture of me sleeping with my Lucario plushie. I sent that picture in personally.

- Do not mention the Tornado card in Clash Royale to me. Just don't.
