## February 1st-14th
_Note: Both of the logs here are being written around the end of February/start of March and are relying on personal journal logs. As of next month all new logs will be completed at or within a few days of their ending time period._

These two weeks marked the actual start of this "blog" where I log my own thoughts about recent projects I have completed, my CodeForces (mis)adventure, and other noteworthy life updates. In this case, asides from getting my first booster for the virus that has been causing a pandemic since March 2020 (yes, it has been that long), not too much event wise out of SFU has occured in these two weeks, so I'll just be recapping the 3 contests I took part in this two week period.

[Round 770](https://codeforces.com/contest/1634) was the first contest of the month, and without wanting to sound repetitive, I ended up solving 3 of the 6 problems somewhat quickly, which led to my official starting rating after the first 6 rated contests being 1527. For context, my initial goal for CodeForces at the start of the year was to reach <span style="color:blue">*Expert*</span>  in 6 months, and with how close I was to reaching that goal after only 6 weeks, given that the rating floor for <span style="color:blue">*Expert*</span> is only 1600, shortly after this contest I readjusted this goal to be more ambitious, to reach <span style="color:purple">*Candidate Master*</span> by the end of the year, which requires a rating of 1900. After all, it would only take a few more contests to reach <span style="color:blue">*Expert*</span> anyways.

The above paragraph was my thoughts on February 7th. I am writing this 3 weeks since then, and for lack of a better or proper explanation:

_Strap in fellow reader, because this is the point where shit really begins to hit the fan._
