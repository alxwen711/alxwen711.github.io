## May 1st-15th

Well then, congratulations to myself (sarcastically) for actually beginning this post in the same month this post is supposed to recap. I can finally say that this blog will be updated on a more consistent up-to-date basis now that the Spring 2022 SFU Term is finally behind me. There isn't much else to talk about other than the two contests that took place in these two weeks because after April 26th, being my last final exam of the term, I could completely chill and relax for a few weeks until the summer term started. There was absolutely nothing else that went wrong within those past few months.

As it turns out, in the last few weeks as of writing while I was scrambling to update this blog's March and April posts, I forgot about a little known competition that I participated in known as **Google Code Jam**. For those unaware, this is one of the largest individual competitive programming competitions hosted by Google.
