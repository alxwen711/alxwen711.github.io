## April 1st-15th

Welcome back to my attempt to catch up this journal to the current present day of May 11th. Optimistically, at the rate I'm going, this journal will finally be up to date by the time the May entries are finished. While the courseload I was taking this term was being a massive pain as usual, these two weeks were actually quite tame compared to the last month, even if one of my finals was on April 13th. With the spring term coming to a close, and my recent results in past contests being not bad for a change, my confidence at this point was actually good. 

What proceeded to occur these two weeks were two of my best contests runs yet. Going into [Round 781](https://codeforces.com/contest/1665#) I was still looking to return to the <span style="color:cyan">**Specialist**</span> level as I was still at 1398 ELO before this contest. By the end of this contest though, I would gain 148 ELO with an estimated contest performance level of **1922** ELO. It's actually a bit unusual how I pulled this off, as I still only solved 3 of the 5 problems in this contest, but although [Problem C](https://codeforces.com/contest/1665/problem/C) was not solved for me since I have a weak point with tree related problems, this was my first contest where I fully solved [Problem D](https://codeforces.com/contest/1665/problem/D). Problem D itself is an example of what I mean when the question difficulty pivots from implementation to actually determining the solution; Problem C's solution is relatively easier to find as it just requires simulating the tree, and then using a greedy method by choosing to infect whichever node has the most healthy children remaining. I ended up finding this solution but was unable to implement it in a viable O(n) or O(n log n) time successfully. Problem D on the other hand is trickier to figure out how to solve the problem to begin with, but I figured out the solution, implementing it was actually quite simple compared to Problem C. The editorial for the contest explains the solution to this problem as well as an alternative method that can determine the number in at most 22 queries instead of 30 needed for the method I used, but as a hint, you can determine the value x by using each query to determine one bit at a time; the first query should be used to determine the bit with a value of 1, then the second query builds on that info to determine the bit with a value of 2, then the third query uses that info to determine the bit with a value of 4, and so on. Due to Problem D being worth more points than Problem C, I effectively beat everyone in the contest who solved Problems A to C, and lose to everyone who solved at least Problems A to D. Combined with my speed in solving the problems, this contest was my first time gaining over 100 effective ELO, my first top 500 finish in a contest, my first time solving a 2000-rated problem (prior to this, my best solve was a 1600-rated problem), my first <span style="color:purple">**Candidate Master**</span> level performance, AND it brought me back within striking distance of my original goal of reaching <span style="color:blue">**Expert**</span> in 6 months, being only 54 ELO away from 1600.

After that breakout performance, it is reasonable to think that the next contest I took part in, [Educational Round 126](https://codeforces.com/contest/1661), my performance would be more inline with previous contests. And it was, but not by that much. I still solved 3 out of 6 problems, and while there was no miracle Problem D solve, my speed on the first 3 problems was good enough to give me a back-to-back top 1000 finish in contests, and this 1818 ELO level performance was enough to push my rating to 1618.

I have done it, I have officially reached <span style="color:blue">**Expert**</span> on CodeForces. Throughout the last 4 months, the most significant challenge was consistency. You see, to reach 1600 ELO, there is two main paths to doing so:

1. Consistently solve Problems A through C on Division 2 level contests at a relatively fast pace each contest, how fast depends on the difficulty of Problem C, or:

2. Have a high enough skill cap to at least occasionally be able to solve Problem D, and rely on gaining significant rating from the contests where you can solve A through D to offset losses when you can only solve A to C slowly or worse. 

For most contests I have the structual knowledge to solve Problems A through C each time, but I would have inconsistent contests at times where I either failed to solve Problem C, or would end up taking an egrigiously long time to solve the easier Problem B. As such, the main improvement I made over the last 4 months was being able to apply mathematical knowledge to the more complex problems more consistently. Naturally the main cause of this improvement is doing more practice problems. In particular for practicing, doing problems rated from 800 up to around 100-200 points above your skill level evenly is optimal; most guides will tell you to always do problems around 100-200 points above your level, but equally as important is being able to solve easier problems consistently and quickly so that you are left with enough time to tackle the harder problems at your skillcap. That and making sure you are actually physically and mentally prepared for the contest are key to actually doing well.

In other news besides me reaching my CodeForces goal 2 months early, I turned 20 on April 5th. Happy birthday to me. 

## April 16th-30th

The second half of April, looking at my pretty much blank GitHub submissions and my pretty much non-existant journal entries from this time, were a result of two things:

1. SFU Spring Term *finally* ended, and for lack of a better explanation, all the stress from that term pretty much recoiled back to me and I pretty much burnt out for a solid week, and

2. There's still final exams. Not going to say which course, but for one particular course, due to the mess that was last month, I pretty much was forced to "learn" (ie. cram) half of the course material in about 6 days. I'm still not exactly sure how I pulled through that.

Combine the above with the fact that this entry was started on May 20th and it's understandable that my recollection of the 3 competitions that occured in this period are a bit foggy. Regardless, I'll do my best in recapping them:
