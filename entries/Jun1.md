## June 1st-15th

Much of these two weeks saw myself mainly preparing applications for a potential co-op next semester, so I was only able to participate in one contest this time. However, this one contest is a blatant indication of my weaknesses in competitive programming.

### [Round 798](https://codeforces.com/contest/1689)

Problems Solved: A, B

New rating: **1625** (-52)

Performance: **1458**

The only reason this contest wasn’t a catastrophe was because I solved the first two problems quickly. What proceeded to follow was 100 minutes of Alex Wen suffering on yet another problem involving trees. [Problem C](https://codeforces.com/contest/1689/problem/C) is one of many cases with tree problems where I understand how to solve it, but struggle with implementing the solution. The optimal “tree pruning” involves only cutting nodes directly connected to the most recently infected node. If the most recently infected node has two children, then the child that would “save” the most vertices in the short term is cut, and the process repeats with the other child being the newest infection. Otherwise, there will be no further infections. This pruning method is exactly the same as the one presented in this contest’s editorial, except there is a dp method used to determine the prune sequence in reverse order. All of this I had figured out in contest, but I had no idea how to implement this solution in linear time. From this failure, the simple plan to fix this weakness was to upsolve this problem in the coming days and practice further tree-related problems on LeetCode.

This plan then proceeded to stall out when I contracted COVID on June 15th. I may have contracted it earlier given that I began having a dry throat around June 12th. It took until June 22nd for me to finally recover, and to top it all off, I have several applications to finish by June 26th. It’s June 23rd today, and all I really have is a template resume. The upsolving for this question will happen but it will have to wait since I intend on fine tuning a specific resume for each position. Codeforces Global Round 21 is also a contest I intend on participating in, mainly for experience, as it is on June 25th. Pray that a tree problem doesn’t screw me over in that contest as well.
