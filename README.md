Hello, and welcome to my Github Webpage.

On this website I will be posting some of my coding projects as well as many other code related things. I might also write down some math stuff here as well. For now, since this site is using Jekyll to format everything and make sure that this page is not just a wall of HTML code, the sample text below is being kept here for reference. Once enough has been actually created on this website it will be removed.

### Todo list
- **Refactor Python Prime Code**: At the moment the first part is to setup a different page showcasing the updated code, which will be changed to actually be an actual interactive program once I figure out how to add Python plugins and create an interface.

- Find a way to make some of the hyperlinks look nicer than just blue text?

- **About me page**: Goal is to have a more fleshed out about me page, right now there isn't much there

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/programming-liftoff/hello-world/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/programming-liftoff/hello-world/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
